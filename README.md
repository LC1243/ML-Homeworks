# ML-Homeworks

Homeworks of the Machine Learning course, which involve several fields of Supervised Learning, and also some topics of Unsupervised Learning:
 - **Homework 1**: Associative Learning: Decision Trees
 - **Homework 2**: Bayesian and Lazy Learning
 - **Homework 3**: Regression and Neural Networks
 - **Homework 4**:  Clustering (K-Means and EM - Estimation Maximization Algorithm)

Each of this homeworks is divided in 2 parts, a **Pen-And-Paper** part, which focuses on a theoretical problem-solving approach which can be found the solution in `G075.pdf` and **Programming and critical analysis** part, which the solution you can find in `G075.ipynb`.
You can also find each Homework assignment in the respective Homework directory.
